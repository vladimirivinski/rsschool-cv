## Summary

Junior front-end developer. My career change was driven by personal development and studying computer - science. In 2019, courses were taken on the Stepic platform to study computer - science and Java courses. In November 2020, I took the HTML-Academy course, which prompted me to put all my efforts into training.

My high motivation and the life experience gained are the absolute pluses in further development.  A high level of discipline, and dedication, as well as communication skills, will contribute to the growth and development of IT.
